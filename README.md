# HelloWorldSolidity

## "Hello World" Smart Contract Factory sample

This is a simple set of Solidity smart contracts to help introduce and explore Solidity.

Use the Remix IDE located here to run in an Ethereum VM or depoy it to an Ethereum testnet ðŸ˜¯

### HelloWorld.sol
This file is a smart contract that exposes 3 public methods:

- `getMessage()` returns a hello world message (including some embedded emoji to make things interesting). This is a view method which means you can call it on a deployed contract without having to pay gas fees.

- `setCustomMessage()` setter function for a custom message string. This function modifies data on the blockchain and therefore requires gas to run.

- `getCustomMessage()` getter function to retrieve and display custom message. Displays default value if `setCustomMessage()` has not been called.

### hwFactory.sol
This contract is contract-factory that deploys HelloWorld contracts in a public array and exposes public methods to call the getters and setters.

- `createHwContract()` deploys an instance of a HelloWorld smart contract. Accessing the public `hwArray` via the index will return the contract location.

- `hwMessage()` calls the `getMessage` function on a deployed contract. Takes uint array index as parameter and returns string.

- `hwCustomMessage()` calls the `getCustomMessage` function on a deployed contract. 

- `hwSetCustomMessage` calls the `setCustomMessage` function on a deployed contract.

If you're tryna get deeper into Solidity and smart contracts, I highly recommend this course. It's currently the definitive source on the topic.
